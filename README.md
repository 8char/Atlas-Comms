# Comms System Addon

This addon is based on the initial comms system developed by TomSa. I have taken the basic structure and added several new features and improvements to create a more robust and versatile comms system for in-game communication.

## Features

- Advanced configuration options that allow you to customize the behavior of the addon to better suit your needs.
- Dynamically generated comm devices that can be customized and used to communicate with other players or NPCs in-game.
- Code improvements that enhance the overall functionality and performance of the addon.

## Requirements

- Atlas Framework (AtlasUI): Required for unit testing, configuration, UI, and schema validation.
- [LAUX Compiler](https://github.com/8char/laux-compiler): Required for compiling LAUX code.

## Installation

1. Install the LAUX compiler by following the instructions at <https://github.com/8char/laux-compiler#how-to-use>.
2. Run the command `lauxc workspace` to compile the code.
3. Move the compiled code to your `garrysmod/addons` directory.
4. Add the Atlas Framework to your server by following the instructions at <https://github.com/8char/AtlasLibrary#getting-started>.
5. Start your server.
