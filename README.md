# Comms System Addon

This addon is based on the initial comms system developed by TomSa. I have taken the basic structure and added several new features and improvements to create a more robust and versatile comms system for in-game communication.

## Features

- Advanced configuration options that allow you to customize the behavior of the addon to better suit your needs.
- Dynamically generated comm devices that can be customized and used to communicate with other players or NPCs in-game.
- Code improvements that enhance the overall functionality and performance of the addon.
